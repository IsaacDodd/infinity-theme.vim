# INFINITY ∞ ColorScheme

The Infinity ColorScheme is the default colorscheme for the Infinity Editor. It can be used as a colorscheme for any [Vim][vim]/[Neovim][neovim]-based editor. The colorscheme in its current form is really a starting-point, so please expect heavy edits and updates for the latest plugins and features in the future.

## Formats

| Color Scheme   | Description                                                                         |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Infinity Day   | This is a light colorscheme that works well for those desiring a bright background. |
| Infinity Night | For those desiring a darker theme, a night version is also provided.                |

## Installation

The easiest way to install the colorscheme is using the instructions from any vim plugin-manager of your choosing, such as [Vim-Plug][vimplug], [Vundle][vundle], [Pathogen][pathogen], or [minipac][minipac].

If you prefer not to use a plugin-manager, please see `:h package` in your editor for help on how to install the plugin manually.

## Credits
Originally based on the now-deprecated '[Tomorrow][tomorrow]' theme by [Chris Kempson][chriskempson]
which is a theme based on the Hex color conversion functions from the theme "[Desert256][desert256]")
There were also some additions based on the code from the following colorschemes:
* [fruchtig][fruchtig]
* [SpaceVim][spacevim]
* [edge by Sainhe][edge]
